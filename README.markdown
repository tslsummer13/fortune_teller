# First Challenge

Read the code for the `/lucky_numbers` URL. Trace it through RCAV and understand each part. Any questions?

# Second Challenge

Make `/horoscopes` display a list of zodiac signs. There's a hint in the controller file.

Make each zodiac sign a link to a url such as `/horoscopes/leo`, `/horoscopes/cancer`, etc.

# Third Challenge

Make `/horoscopes/leo`, `/horoscopes/cancer`, etc work to display individual fortunes.
